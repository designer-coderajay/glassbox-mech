# Contributing to Glassbox

Thank you for contributing. Glassbox is research software — correctness and mathematical
integrity matter more than feature count. A few principles:

## Before you open a PR

1. **Every new method needs a citation** if it implements or adapts a published technique.
   Add it to the module docstring and the references block at the top of `core.py`.
2. **Every approximation must be disclosed.** If your method produces an approximation,
   add an `APPROXIMATION NOTE (disclosed)` block in the docstring explaining exactly
   what is approximated and when it degrades.
3. **Write tests first.** Add your tests to `tests/test_engine.py` before implementing.
   Use the existing test class structure as a template.
4. **Update the complexity table** in the `core.py` module docstring with the pass count
   for your new method.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/designer-coderajay/glassbox-mech
cd glassbox-mech
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Fast tests only (skips @pytest.mark.slow)
pytest tests/ -m "not slow" -v

# All tests (loads GPT-2 multiple times — takes ~5 min on CPU)
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Code style

- Line length: 100 characters.
- Type annotations: preferred but not required for internal helpers.
- Variable names: use maths-style names (`W_Q`, `d_head`, `n_layers`) consistent with
  Elhage et al. (2021) notation throughout the codebase.

## Adding a new analysis method

1. Add it as a method on `GlassboxV2` in `core.py`.
2. Update the `GlassboxV2` class docstring (Public API section).
3. Update the complexity table in the module docstring.
4. Export it from `__init__.py` if it is a standalone class.
5. Add tests in `tests/test_engine.py`.
6. Update `README.md` — add a row to the "What's Novel" table and a code example.
7. Add a CHANGELOG entry under the version it ships in.

## Bug reports

Please include:
- The exact prompt, correct token, and distractor token you used.
- The model name.
- The full traceback.
- The Glassbox version (`python -c "import glassbox; print(glassbox.__version__)"`).

## Mathematical questions

Open an issue with the `math` label. Include the relevant formula and what you believe
the discrepancy is. We take mathematical accuracy seriously and will respond promptly.

## Legal and regulatory contributions

If you add or modify functionality related to EU AI Act compliance documentation:

1. **Cite the specific article(s)** of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 in the module docstring
   (e.g., `Article 9 — Risk management system`).
2. **Include a LEGAL NOTICE block** in the docstring of any new compliance module,
   following the pattern in `glassbox/compliance.py` and `glassbox/risk_register.py`.
3. **Do not overstate.** Use language like "supports documentation of..." or "aids in
   drafting..." rather than "certifies compliance with..." or "satisfies requirements of..."
4. **Add appropriate hedges** to README examples and section headers when the feature
   touches regulatory obligations. Examples are illustrative; they are not regulatory advice.

By submitting a pull request you confirm that your contribution does not introduce any
claim, representation, or warranty that Glassbox software outputs constitute legal
compliance certifications, regulatory submissions, declarations of conformity, or
legal advice of any kind.
