## 0. One-paragraph summary

Glassbox takes a model's **decision** (a choice between two outcomes), finds the
small set of attention heads that causally drive it, and then **measures** how
well that set explains the decision. It does not ask you to trust the
explanation — it tests it by re-running the model with parts ablated, and reports
the result, including when the explanation is poor. The same evidence is written
into an EU AI Act Annex IV technical-documentation file. The headline empirical
finding that motivates all of this: a model's **confidence is essentially
uncorrelated with the faithfulness of its explanation (r = 0.009)**, so
faithfulness must be measured, not assumed.

## 1. The three layers of assurance — and which is which

Be precise about what is *proven*, what is *measured*, and what is a *hypothesis*.
Only Layer 2 is a measurement; conflating the layers is how interpretability tools
mislead.

### Layer 1 — the circuit (an approximation, not a proof)

The exact causal effect of a component (attention head) on a decision is the
change in the logit-difference when that component's activation is replaced
("patched") with the activation from a contrasting input. Computing that exactly
for every head costs one forward pass per head.

Glassbox uses **attribution patching** — a first-order Taylor approximation:

```
effect(head) ≈ ( a_clean(head) − a_corrupt(head) ) · ∂(logit_diff)/∂a(head)
```

i.e. *activation difference × gradient*, obtained in **3 forward/backward passes
total** instead of one-per-head. This is the method of Nanda (2023) and Syed,
Rager & Conmy (2023). It is fast but **linear**: its error grows where the loss
surface is nonlinear between the clean and corrupted activations. Glassbox
therefore also provides **second-order (Hessian) error bounds** to *bound* that
approximation error rather than ignore it.

**Status:** the circuit is a ranked **hypothesis** with a known error term — not a
theorem about the model's "true reason."

### Layer 2 — faithfulness (this is the measured assurance)

The circuit hypothesis is then **tested empirically** by re-running the model:

- **Sufficiency** — keep only the circuit, ablate the rest. Does the decision
  survive? High = the circuit alone reproduces the decision.
- **Comprehensiveness** — remove the circuit, keep the rest. Does the decision
  break? High = the circuit is necessary.
- **F1** — harmonic mean of the two.

These are the **ERASER faithfulness metrics** (DeYoung et al., 2020). They are
*computed by ablation and re-running the model* — reproducible and falsifiable,
not asserted. **When they are low, the tool says the explanation is incomplete**
(see the worked example below, where gpt2 scores sufficiency 0.48 and is graded C
/ NON-COMPLIANT). That self-honesty is the core trust mechanism.

### Layer 3 — causal-abstraction certificate (the strongest, narrowest claim)

The strongest statement is not "these heads correlate with the decision" but
"this circuit *implements* the declared decision rule." That is tested with
**interchange interventions** and scored as **interchange-intervention accuracy
(IIA)** — the causal-abstraction line of work (Geiger et al.). Glassbox computes
the certificate; generating the interchange trials at production scale is open
research, so it is offered as the top **evidence tier (A)**, not claimed by
default.

---

## 2. What is NOT guaranteed (state this to every buyer)

- It does **not** prove the circuit is the *unique* cause. Models have backup
  mechanisms — multiple sufficient circuits (the IOI "backup name-mover"
  phenomenon is the textbook case).
- Faithfulness is an empirical claim about **the inputs you tested**, not a
  theorem over all inputs. This is why Glassbox reports **bootstrap confidence
  intervals** over a distribution of prompts rather than a single number.
- A metric like "sufficiency 0.48" is a **defined quantity**, not "48% true."
- **High faithfulness ≠ a good or fair decision.** Faithfulness measures whether
  the explanation matches the model's actual computation — not whether the
  decision itself is correct, lawful, or unbiased. Keep these separate.

---

## 3. Why you can trust it (structural, not "trust the vendor")

1. Every number is **computed by re-running the model** — reproducible by the auditor.
2. The methods are from the **peer-reviewed literature**, not invented:
   ERASER faithfulness (DeYoung et al., 2020); attribution patching (Nanda, 2023;
   Syed et al., 2023); ACDC baseline (Conmy et al., NeurIPS 2023); causal
   abstraction / IIA (Geiger et al.).
3. A **conformance suite** gates the implementation on each model (determinism,
   patch-identity) before any number is believed.
4. An **evidence-tier label (A–D)** forces honest scoping of every result.
5. It is **open source** — the regulator can run it themselves.
6. It is honest about failure: it returns NON-COMPLIANT when a model's decision
   cannot be faithfully explained, instead of fabricating a clean story.

*Empirical basis for the whole approach:* confidence–faithfulness correlation
**r = 0.009** — a model's own confidence tells you nothing about whether its
explanation is real.

## 4. Scope and limits (the honest boundary)

- **White-box only.** The method needs weights, activations, and gradients. It
  works on **open-weight models you can load** (GPT-2 family verified;
  Llama / Mistral / Phi via adapters). It does **not** work through a closed API
  (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) — you cannot extract activations or gradients from an
  API, so those get only the weaker **black-box behavioral tier**, not circuits.
- **Decisions, not free-form chat.** The audit needs a decision framed as a
  contrast between outcomes (approve/deny, hire/reject, flag/clear). Free-form
  generation has no contrast to attribute against.
- **Offline / sampled, not per-request.** At ~3 passes + gradients per analysis,
  this audits representative decisions to produce documentation and periodic
  monitoring — it is not a real-time monitor on billions of production requests.
- **Verified scope today** (see `VALIDATION_LOG.md`): conformance gate PASS across
  **6 architecture families** (GPT-2, Pythia/GPT-NeoX, GPT-Neo, OPT, Qwen2-GQA,
  Mistral-GQA) **up to 12B**; and **faithfulness (suff + comp, both rigor-controlled)
  validated 82M → 12B across 9 architecture families** (ten model series; Yi uses
  the Llama architecture) including every major GQA family
  (Llama-3, Mistral, Gemma-2, Qwen2/2.5, Yi, Phi-3), via scale-aware circuit
  selection — comprehensiveness is specificity-checked against a random same-size
  circuit at every scale (comp ~1.0 vs random 0.0–0.29).
  **Not yet validated:** 13B–200B (needs a multi-GPU cluster + the unproven
  distributed backend; a single 80 GB GPU tops out ~13–30B for gradient-based
  attribution), production throughput, and closed APIs.

## 5. EU AI Act mapping — and the honest legal limit

Glassbox produces **evidence and documentation** toward specific obligations:

| Obligation | What Glassbox contributes |
|---|---|
| **Art. 11 + Annex IV** (technical documentation) | Auto-fills 8 of 9 sections from the circuit + faithfulness evidence; §8 (Declaration of Conformity) is left for human sign-off. |
| **Art. 13** (transparency) | The faithfulness-graded circuit is measured transparency evidence. |
| **Art. 15** (accuracy, robustness) | Robustness / multi-corruption tests + held-out validation. |
| **Art. 9 / Art. 72** (risk management, post-market monitoring) | Risk register + CUSUM drift detector. |
| NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001 | Same evidence cross-walked to those frameworks (theme level). |

**The legal limit — do not overstate.** The EU AI Act does **not** mandate
mechanistic interpretability and defines **no faithfulness threshold**. The
`overall_status: NON-COMPLIANT` produced by the tool is **Glassbox's own internal
gate, not a legal ruling** — never present it as a regulator's verdict. Conformity
is determined by the provider's conformity assessment (self-assessment or a
notified body) against harmonised standards that are still being written.
Glassbox's output is a strong **input** to that process; it does not by itself
make anyone compliant, and it is **not legal advice or certification**.

Enforcement dates: high-risk obligations apply from **2 August 2026** under
current law; the **Digital Omnibus** (provisionally agreed 7 May 2026, pending
formal adoption) would defer the Annex III timeline to **2 December 2027** — plan
against both until it is adopted. Documentation non-compliance penalty: up to
**€15M or 3% of global annual turnover** (Art. 99(4)).

## 6. Worked example (reproduces the honesty)

`examples/loan_decision_audit.py` runs a loan-approval-style decision on gpt2 end
to end. gpt2 cannot underwrite, so it scores **sufficiency ≈ 0.48, F1 ≈ 0.58,
Grade C**, and the report is marked **NON-COMPLIANT** — the correct outcome for a
model with no real decision circuit. The plumbing (real model → real circuit →
measured faithfulness → Annex IV file) is what is real; point it at a fine-tuned
decision model for a meaningful audit.
