glassbox/compliance.py — EU AI Act Annex IV Technical Documentation Generator
==============================================================================

LEGAL NOTICE — DOCUMENTATION AID ONLY
---------------------------------------
This module is a software tool that drafts technical documentation structured
in accordance with Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 ("EU AI Act").
It is provided strictly as a documentation aid and research instrument.

Use of this module does NOT:
  - constitute legal advice or a legal opinion;
  - guarantee, certify, or represent regulatory compliance;
  - constitute a Declaration of Conformity under EU AI Act Article 47;
  - replace a conformity assessment by a notified body (Article 43);
  - determine whether the subject AI system is "high-risk" under Article 6.

All generated reports must be reviewed, validated, and signed by the
responsible persons within the deploying organisation before regulatory use.
Consult qualified legal counsel for jurisdiction-specific guidance.

> **EU AI Act Compliance Report** generated by [Glassbox](https://repo-ashen-psi.vercel.app) v{_get_version()}
> Report ID: {self._report_id} · Generated: {created_str}

## Model Description

**Purpose:** {self.system_purpose}

**Provider:** {self.provider_name}, {self.provider_address}

**Deployment context:** {deploy_ctx.replace("_", " ").title()}

**Risk classification:** {risk_level.replace("_", " ").title()} under EU AI Act Annex III

## Intended Use

{self.system_purpose}

This model has been audited for EU AI Act Annex IV compliance. Deployment is
authorised only for the stated purpose and deployment context listed above.

## EU AI Act Compliance Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Annex IV documentation | ✅ Complete (all 9 sections) |
| Explainability grade | **{grade_str}** (Article 13) |
| Risk assessment | ✅ Completed (Article 9) |
| Data governance documented | {'✅' if getattr(s4, 'training_data_description', '') else '⚠️ Partial'} |
| Declaration of conformity | ⚠️ Provider must execute (Article 47) |
| Post-market monitoring plan | ✅ Documented (Article 72) |

**Overall compliance status:** `{compliance_status.replace("_", " ").title()}`

> Enforcement deadline: **August 2026** — Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, Article 99(4):
> non-compliance penalties up to €15M or 3% of global annual turnover.

## Explainability Metrics (Article 13)

These metrics are generated by Glassbox mechanistic interpretability analysis
using attribution patching (Nanda et al. 2023) and minimum faithful circuit
discovery.

| Metric | Score | Threshold (Grade A) |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Sufficiency | `{suff:.3f}` | ≥ 0.80 |
| Comprehensiveness | `{comp:.3f}` | ≥ 0.60 |
| F1 (harmonic mean) | `{f1:.3f}` | ≥ 0.80 |
| **Explainability grade** | **{grade_str}** | A = fully explainable |

Sufficiency measures whether the identified circuit alone recovers the model's
prediction. Comprehensiveness measures how much ablating the circuit degrades
performance. F1 is the harmonic mean of both.

## Identified Risks (Article 9)

{risk_lines}

## Training Data (Article 10)

See full Annex IV Section 4 — Data Governance in the [compliance report JSON].

## Audit Trail

- **Audit method:** {'White-box (mechanistic interpretability)' if self._analyses and self._analyses[0].get('circuit') else 'Black-box (behavioural audit)'}
- **Tool:** Glassbox v{_get_version()} — [github.com/designer-coderajay/glassbox-mech](https://github.com/designer-coderajay/glassbox-mech)
- **Regulation:** Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act) — [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689)
