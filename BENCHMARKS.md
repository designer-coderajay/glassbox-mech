# Glassbox AI — Benchmark Results

**Version:** 4.2.6
**Last updated:** 2026-04-02

All benchmarks measure wall-clock time from `gb.analyze()` call to returned
result dict, on a single CPU core unless stated. Every approximation is
disclosed. Results are reproducible with `scripts/benchmark.py`.

## 1. Core Engine Speed — GPT-2 Small (12L/12H/768d)

| Method | Passes | Time (M1 Pro, 16GB) | Time (CPU, 8-core) | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| `analyze()` (Taylor approx) | 3 | **1.8 s** | **4.2 s** | `suff_is_approx=True` |
| `analyze()` (EAP) | 3 | 2.1 s | 4.9 s | Edge attribution patching |
| `bootstrap_metrics()` (exact) | 3 + 2·|C| | 8.4 s | 22.1 s | `exact_suff=True` |
| ACDC (Conmy et al. 2023) | O(E) | ~65 s | ~180 s | Reference implementation |

**Speedup vs ACDC:** 15–37× depending on circuit size and hardware.
Measured on IOI task, GPT-2 Small, `seed=42`, PyTorch 2.3.0, TransformerLens 1.19.0.

## 2. Core Engine Speed — Pythia-1.4B (24L/16H/2048d)

| Method | Passes | Time (M1 Pro, 16GB) | Time (CPU, 8-core) |
|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `analyze()` (Taylor approx) | 3 | **8.3 s** | **19.6 s** |
| `bootstrap_metrics()` (exact) | 3 + 2·|C| | 31.2 s | 74.8 s |

## 3. Faithfulness Metrics — IOI Task

The Indirect Object Identification (IOI) benchmark (Wang et al. 2022) is the
standard mechanistic interpretability validation task. Prompt:
`"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to"`
Correct token: `" Mary"` | Incorrect token: `" John"`

| Model | Sufficiency | Comprehensiveness | F1_faith | Circuit (n_heads) | Grade |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|-------|
| GPT-2 Small (current build, default circuit) | 1.00 (exact) | 0.543 | 0.704 | 1 | B |
| GPT-2 Medium † | 0.84 (approx) | 0.41 | 0.55 | 31 | C |
| Pythia-1.4B † | 0.76 (approx) | 0.44 | 0.56 | 19 | C |

GPT-2 Small is the re-measured canonical (current build): the scale-aware default
circuit reaches **exact** sufficiency with a 1-head circuit — suff 1.00,
comp 0.543, **F1 0.704, Grade B** (grade per the code's own thresholds, see
"Grade thresholds" below). Reproduced by `analyze()` and
`scripts/validate_models_matrix.py`.

† Earlier-build approximate figures, **pending re-measurement** on the current
scale-aware build — do not cite as current without a fresh run (see
`VALIDATION_LOG.md`).

Note: the IOI task was specifically designed for GPT-2. Faithfulness scores
on other tasks (e.g. credit scoring, medical triage) differ significantly.

## 4. Compliance Use Case — Decision Tasks (and honest failure)

**Task prompt (credit):** `"The loan applicant has a credit score of 620. The bank decision is"`
**Correct:** `" approved"` | **Incorrect:** `" denied"`

This prompt is representative of high-risk AI system use cases under
EU AI Act Annex III (credit scoring) and Article 9 risk management.

**Measured on the current build** via `benchmarks/run_decision_functional.py`
(`--model gpt2 --method taylor`, V5 verbalizer sets, exact-ablation faithfulness;
raw output committed at `benchmarks/results/decision_functional_2026-10-05.json`; re-run
2026-10-05 reproduced every row below exactly):

| Task | Model-correct? | Sufficiency | Comprehensiveness | F1_faith | Concentration | Tier |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|------|
| credit_approval | no (predicts " denied") | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.63× | C |
| credit_denial | yes | 0.047 | 0.396 | 0.083 | 7.24× | C |
| medical_triage | yes | 0.465 | 0.318 | 0.378 | 12.37× | C |
| employment_screening | no | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 1.89× | C |
| fraud_flag | yes | 0.851 | 0.077 | 0.141 | 2.26× | C |

**This is the point, not a defect.** Raw GPT-2 Small (124M) is *not* a decision
model — it has no faithful credit/underwriting circuit, so the tool correctly
returns **low faithfulness, Grade C, and would mark the audit NON-COMPLIANT**
rather than fabricate a clean explanation. (Concentration > 1× confirms the
discovered heads still beat a random set — the attribution is real; the model's
*decision competence* is what's absent.) A meaningful credit audit requires a
model actually fine-tuned to underwrite; point the harness at one to get a
passing grade.

> **Correction (2026-06-15):** earlier editions of this file reported GPT-2 Small
> credit as suff 0.73 / F1 0.61 / Grade B (14 heads), with similar passing rows
> for GPT-2 Medium / GPT-Neo-125M / Pythia-160M. Those figures **do not reproduce
> on the current exact-measurement build** (most likely an earlier build whose
> *approximate* sufficiency over-shot — the same effect fixed for IOI). They have
> been replaced with the measured current-build results above. The other models
> are pending re-measurement and should not be cited until re-run.

## 5. Multi-Agent Audit — Chain Risk Assessment Speed

Measured on a 4-agent chain with 100-token outputs per agent.

| n_agents | Bias categories | Time (CPU) |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| 2 | 8 | 0.04 s |
| 4 | 8 | 0.07 s |
| 8 | 8 | 0.14 s |
| 16 | 8 | 0.28 s |

The multi-agent audit is O(n_agents × n_tokens). No model inference is
required — all computation is lexical and statistical.

---

## 6. Steering Vector Extraction Speed

Measured on `extract_mean_diff()` with 3 contrast pairs, layer 8,
GPT-2 Small.

| Operation | Time (M1 Pro) | Time (CPU, 8-core) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Extract (3 pairs, 1 layer) | 0.9 s | 2.1 s |
| Extract (10 pairs, 1 layer) | 2.8 s | 6.7 s |
| `apply()` (1 hook, greedy decode) | 0.3 s | 0.7 s |
| `test_suppression()` (2× analyze) | 3.7 s | 8.5 s |

---

## 7. Evidence Vault Build Speed

`build_annex_iv_vault()` with all inputs: gb_result + multiagent_report +
4 steering vectors + 20 SAE features + stability_result.

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| `build_vault()` (all inputs) | < 0.1 s |
| `to_html()` (full report) | < 0.1 s |
| `to_json()` | < 0.1 s |

The vault is pure Python data manipulation — no model inference. Time is
dominated by JSON serialisation.

## 8. Peer-Reviewed Results — arXiv:2603.09988

The following figures are the **primary source of truth** for Glassbox's faithfulness
claims. They come directly from the MSc research paper:

> **Mahale, A.P. (2026).** *Causally Grounded Mechanistic Interpretability for LLMs
> with Faithful Natural Language Explanations.* arXiv:2603.09988.
> [https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.09988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.09988)

> Code: [Causally-Grounded-Mechanistic-Interpretability-for-LLMs-with-Faithful-Natural-Language-Explanations](https://github.com/designer-coderajay/Causally-Grounded-Mechanistic-Interpretability-for-LLMs-with-Faithful-Natural-Language-Explanations)

**Model:** GPT-2 Small (124M) · **Task:** Indirect Object Identification (IOI)

### Circuit Analysis (Wang et al. 2022 IOI benchmark)

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Circuit heads identified | 6 | Minimal faithful set |
| Circuit coverage (logit diff) | **61.4%** | % of prediction explained |
| Sufficiency | **100.0%** | Prediction preserved using only cited heads |
| Comprehensiveness | **22.0%** | Prediction reduction when ablating cited heads |
| Local Faithfulness Score (F1) | **36.0%** | Harmonic mean of S and Comp |

> This block is the **6-head minimal** circuit (S 1.00 · C 0.22 · F1 0.36 — self-
> consistent). It is *not* the current canonical. The current build's **default**
> circuit on this task is a **1-head** circuit scoring **suff 1.00 · comp 0.543 ·
> F1 0.704 · Grade B** (see the model table at the top of this file). The
> **full 26-head** Wang et al. circuit scores **S 1.00 · C 0.47 · F1 0.64**
> (paper reference). Three different circuit definitions, three different F1s —
> always state which circuit a number refers to.

### Head-Level Attribution (Global Importance)

| Head | Role | Global Importance |
|------|------|------------------|
| L9H9 | Name Mover (Primary) | 17.4% |
| L8H10 | S-Inhibition | 12.3% |
| L7H3 | Name Mover (Secondary) | 10.3% |
| L10H6 | Backup Name Mover | 8.9% |
| L9H6 | Name Mover (Tertiary) | 6.3% |
| L10H0 | Output Head | 6.2% |

### Explanation Quality

| Method | Quality Score |
|--------|--------------|
| Template baseline | 1.0× |
| LLM-generated (Glassbox) | **+64%** over template |
| Attention baseline | **+75%** beat |

### Confidence–Faithfulness Orthogonality

```
r = 0.009   (Pearson correlation, model confidence vs explanation faithfulness)
S = 1.00    Sufficiency      (full 26-head Wang et al. IOI circuit)
Comp = 0.47 Comprehensiveness (full circuit; the 6-head minimal circuit has Comp = 0.22)
F1 = 0.64   (full 26-head circuit; harmonic mean of S=1.00 and Comp=0.47)
```

**Interpretation:** `r = 0.009` means model confidence and explanation faithfulness are
essentially uncorrelated — high confidence does not imply a faithful explanation, and
vice versa. This is a core finding of the paper, not a performance score.

**What r = 0.009 does *not* show (corrected 2026-10-05).**
- An earlier version of this section said that r = 0.009 shows Glassbox explanations
  are "mechanistically grounded" and "driven by causal circuit structure".
- A near-zero correlation supports only the narrower point above: confidence does not
  predict faithfulness, so faithfulness has to be measured.
- It says nothing about how the explanations are produced, and it is not evidence of
  their quality. See `ASSURANCE.md` row L5.

### Limitations Disclosed in Paper

- All results restricted to the IOI task on GPT-2 Small
- Comprehensiveness gap (~78%) reflects distributed backup mechanisms
- Results should not be generalised to arbitrary tasks or model families without
  further empirical validation

## 9. Reproducibility

All GPT-2 benchmarks above are reproducible using `scripts/benchmark.py`:

```bash
pip install glassbox-mech-interp
python scripts/benchmark.py --model gpt2 --task ioi --seed 42
python scripts/benchmark.py --model gpt2 --task credit --seed 42
python scripts/benchmark.py --suite full --output results/bench_v340.json
```

Hardware used for the published results:
- Apple M1 Pro (8-core CPU, 16 GB unified memory)
- Python 3.11.8, PyTorch 2.3.0, TransformerLens 1.19.0

Results on other hardware will vary. ACDC reference timings from the
original paper (Conmy et al. 2023, NeurIPS) on an NVIDIA A100.

## 10. Benchmark Methodology Notes

- All times are wall-clock (including tokenisation, cache transfer, result
  formatting). Model weights are pre-loaded; load time is excluded.
- Sufficiency (Taylor approx) uses `suff_is_approx=True` — the gradient
  approximation, not exact positive ablation.
- Exact sufficiency uses `bootstrap_metrics(exact_suff=True)`.
- Grade thresholds (the code's own, `compliance.py:_compute_grade`, all conditions
  must hold): **A** = suff ≥ 0.80 ∧ comp ≥ 0.60 ∧ F1 ≥ 0.80; **B** = suff ≥ 0.65
  ∧ comp ≥ 0.40 ∧ F1 ≥ 0.65; **C** = F1 ≥ 0.50; **D** otherwise. (A grade is
  multi-dimensional — F1 alone does not determine it.)
- Every result carries `suff_is_approx: bool` so downstream users know
  whether the exact or approximate method was used.
